### Hi, folks ðŸ‘‹

 I'm Roger, from Curitiba-PR - Brazil.
 I'm a Front-End Developer with almost 3 years of experience. I also have +8 years working as a IT Analyst. Last but not the least, I'm a sports fan! Running, hiking, soccer, baskteball, curling, swimming, "frescoball", gamer, camping, cycling, etc..

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on TrueChange as a Front End developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Vue.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I had a chance to create a patch of Winning Eleven game almost 10 years ago. Really cool!

Feel free to reach me and chat. Take care :D
